Problem: 
Tourists arrive in the beautiful island of Jamaica, seeking to enjoy the nice beaches and breath taking landscape. Some of Jamaica's best gems aren't mainstream as the more popular options sometimes provided by hotels or tour guides. This application provides users with a variety of local, 'not so popular' gems based on a recommended list and also your current location.

JamTravel, an app that brings you to the unique culture and hidden gems of the small but 'tallawah' Jamaica.

Solution:

App Layout:

First Page: Welcome Page
This screen greets you with a simple graphic that is authentic to the culture, and showcase vibrant colors, as is the culture.

Second Page: Home Page
This page is ultimately consisted of 3 widgets:
1. Location Widget: this displays your current location once permissions are granted.
2. Recommendation Widget: this widget pulls from a predefined api listing that should be routinely updated on the current recommended places depending on the season.
3. Nearby Places: this widget should compare your current location against the location of the listing of recommended places. Any location within a defined radius, should be displayed. [This function is not fully implemented]. As it is now, a listing is displayed from an api.

Third Page: Details Page
This page displays the image, name, date of a selected recommended place. There is also a button that once selected should bring you to the companies'/tours' page to book a tour. [Not fully implemented]
