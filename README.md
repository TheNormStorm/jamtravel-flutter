# jamtravel

JamTravel, an app that brings you to the unique culture and hidden gems of the small but 'tallawah' Jamaica.

## Getting Started

App Layout:

First Page: Welcome Page
This screen greets you with a simple graphic that is authentic to the culture, and showcase vibrant colors, as is the culture.

Second Page: Home Page
This page is ultimately consisted of 3 widgets:
1. Location Widget: this displays your current location once permissions are granted.
2. Recommendation Widget: this widget pulls from a predefined api listing that should be routinely updated on the current recommended places depending on the season.
3. Nearby Places: this widget should compare your current location against the location of the listing of recommended places. Any location within a defined radius, should be displayed. [This function is not fully implemented]. As it is now, a listing is displayed from an api.

Third Page: Details Page
This page displays the image, name, date of a selected recommended place. There is also a button that once selected should bring you to the companies'/tours' page to book a tour. [Not fully implemented]
